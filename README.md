# OpinionFormation
Project for earth dynamics lecture 2017

#Ideas
- Upper limit for opinion changes for every node
- Multiple Categories of Opinions, set of parameters with different weights
- parameter that controls tendency to change opinion
- adapt your opinion to the majority of your friends' opinions and not to a single one!


# Problems?
- process2 takes random friend at sets it opinion to "my opinion" no matter whether it already is my opinion or not
